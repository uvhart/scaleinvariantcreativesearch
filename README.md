1. AllNeighbors.txt: contains the list of the neighbors for each shape in the network of shapes.
2. MeaningAll8.txt: Meaning scores for each shape in the network of shapes. 
3. fcd_nofcd data generation and analysis.nb: contains the code for analysis of the behavioral trajectories, create the simulations for FCD circuits, non-FCD circuits, fGn processes, fBm processes, and analyze the AIC/BIC scores of the FCD/non-FCD circuits.
